Implementation of RAID algorithm utilizing Reed-Solomon (RS) codes called RAID-RS. 
 The implementation is based on steps presented in this [paper](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/papers/CS-96-332.pdf).
A follow-up was presented in [this paper](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/papers/CS-03-504.pdf).
